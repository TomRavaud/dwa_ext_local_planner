# Local Planner Configuration

This folder contains the configuration files for the local planner. The parameters are written in a YAML file (**dwa_ext_planner.yaml**) and are loaded by the local planner at runtime. Some parameters can be reconfigured dynamically (those written in the **DWAExtPlanner.cfg** file), while others require a restart of the local planner.
